# Comments-Section-Knockout

This is a small project which creates a Comment Section as could be seen on any E-commerce platform for gathering user comments.
This application is made using Knockout.js as framework.

The Project utilizes a dummy data as a feed of user comments which could be seen in main.js . This data could be modified as per requirement
as the application could fetch a Json as user comments.

I have used fontello icons to actually get the user , save and cancel icons to the application.

To run the application just open the index.html
